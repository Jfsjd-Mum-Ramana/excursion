As a developer,

I need to analyze the requirements for the MCP and Trap trends graph in the Overall Health Metrics dashboard.

This includes understanding the UI implementations, database structure, data sources, and API requirements for visualizing a scatter plot that dynamically updates based on the selected data type and protocol.

Additionally, I need to create the necessary database tables and populate them with dummy data to proceed with the development.

Technical Details
UI Components: Scatter plot visualization, color coding for different protocols, dynamic updates based on data type selection.
Database Structure: Tables and relationships to store data for different protocols and data types.
Data Sources: Identification and integration of data sources for SNMP perf, WSS, gRPC, TL1, syslog, etc.
API Requirements: Endpoints to fetch data for the scatter plot, handle different data types, and support dynamic updates.
Tasks
Analyze UI Implementations: Identify and document the necessary UI components and interactions for the scatter plot.
Analyze Database Structure: Identify and document the necessary tables and relationships to support the new data types and protocols.
Analyze Data Sources: Identify and document the sources of data for each protocol and how the data will be collected, processed, and stored.
Analyze API Requirements: Identify and document the necessary endpoints and request/response formats to support the dynamic updates of the scatter plot.
Create Database Tables: Define and create the necessary database tables to store protocol data and collection types.
Populate Tables with Dummy Data: Insert sample data into the database tables for different protocols and data types.
Compile Findings: Compile all findings into a detailed implementation plan.

3. Tasks Breakdown

Analyze UI Implementations

UI Components and Interactions:

Scatter Plot: This plot will display metrics as points with x and y values. The x axis will represent timestamps, while the y axis will show metric values (e.g., performance, trap counts).

Color Coding: Each protocol (SNMP, WSS, gRPC, etc.) will be represented with a distinct color to differentiate them visually.

Dynamic Updates: The scatter plot should update dynamically when a user selects a different protocol or data type from dropdown menus. This can be achieved using React state and API calls.


Example UI Code (React/TypeScript):

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Scatter } from "react-chartjs-2";

const ScatterPlot: React.FC = () => {
  const [protocols, setProtocols] = useState([]);
  const [selectedProtocol, setSelectedProtocol] = useState<number>(1);
  const [dataTypes, setDataTypes] = useState([]);
  const [selectedDataType, setSelectedDataType] = useState<number>(1);
  const [metricsData, setMetricsData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/protocols").then(res => res.json()).then(setProtocols);
    fetch("/api/data-types").then(res => res.json()).then(setDataTypes);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/metrics?protocolId=${selectedProtocol}&dataTypeId=${selectedDataType}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setMetricsData);
  }, [selectedProtocol, selectedDataType]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Select Protocol</h3>
      <select onChange={(e) => setSelectedProtocol(Number(e.target.value))}>
        {protocols.map((protocol) => (
          <option key={protocol.id} value={protocol.id}>{protocol.name}</option>
        ))}
      </select>
      
      <h3>Select Data Type</h3>
      <select onChange={(e) => setSelectedDataType(Number(e.target.value))}>
        {dataTypes.map((dataType) => (
          <option key={dataType.id} value={dataType.id}>{dataType.name}</option>
        ))}
      </select>

      <Scatter
        data={{
          datasets: [{
            label: "Metrics Data",
            data: metricsData.map((item) => ({
              x: new Date(item.timestamp).getTime(),
              y: item.metric_value,
            })),
            backgroundColor: "rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.5)", // Example color
          }],
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ScatterPlot;

4. Conclusion

This document outlines the requirements and steps to implement the MCP and Trap trends graph. The following key components were covered:

1. UI Implementation: Design and implementation of the scatter plot with dynamic updates based on protocol and data type selection.


2. Database Structure: Required tables and relationships to store protocol and data type information.


3. Data Sources: Identification of data sources and the approach for collecting and storing the data.


4. API Requirements: Endpoints to fetch and return data to the front-end in real-time.


5. Database Tables and Dummy Data: SQL scripts for creating the database schema and populating with sample



Certainly! Below is the updated structure for **PostgreSQL** with explanations. The changes from the original SQL are primarily around the **data types** and how constraints are defined in PostgreSQL.

---

### **PostgreSQL Database Structure with `id` Column**

#### **1. `ucs_collections` Table**

##### **Purpose:**
This table stores metadata about each collection, including details about the devices involved and the source of the data.

##### **Create Table Query (PostgreSQL Syntax):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE ucs_collections (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier for each collection (Primary Key)
    collection_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- Name of the collection (Unique constraint)
    device_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Name of the device
    device_ip INET NOT NULL,  -- IP address of the device (Using PostgreSQL's INET type for IPs)
    ucg_source VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Source of the UCG data
    vendor VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL  -- Vendor associated with the device
);
```

##### **Explanation:**
- **`id`**: The `id` column is defined as **`SERIAL`**, which auto-increments in PostgreSQL. This means that a new value is automatically generated for each new row.
- **`collection_name`**: This is the name of the collection. It's marked **`NOT NULL`** and has a **`UNIQUE`** constraint to ensure that no two collections have the same name.
- **`device_ip`**: The `INET` type is used for the `device_ip` column to ensure that only valid IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6) are stored.
  
---

#### **2. `collection_metrics` Table**

##### **Purpose:**
This table stores the metrics related to each collection, with a foreign key linking to the `ucs_collections` table based on `collection_name`.

##### **Create Table Query (PostgreSQL Syntax):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE collection_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier for each metric (Primary Key)
    collection_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Name of the collection (Foreign Key)
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,  -- Timestamp of the last update (with default value)
    number_of_msgs INT NOT NULL,  -- Number of messages in the collection
    size_of_msgs BIGINT NOT NULL,  -- Size of messages in bytes (supports large sizes)
    
    -- Foreign Key constraint to ensure referential integrity
    CONSTRAINT fk_collection_name FOREIGN KEY (collection_name) REFERENCES ucs_collections(collection_name) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
    -- Ensure collection_name is unique within the metrics table (a collection can have only one metric entry)
    CONSTRAINT unique_collection_metric UNIQUE (collection_name)
);
```

##### **Explanation:**
- **`id`**: The `id` column is again defined as **`SERIAL`** to auto-increment with each new entry.
- **`collection_name`**: This is the foreign key linking `collection_metrics` to `ucs_collections`. It refers to the `collection_name` column in `ucs_collections` and enforces referential integrity.
- **`ON DELETE CASCADE`**: This ensures that when a record in `ucs_collections` is deleted, all related entries in `collection_metrics` will also be automatically deleted.
- **`last_updated`**: This column is set to the current timestamp by default when a record is created.
- **`BIGINT`**: Used for `size_of_msgs` to store large message sizes (in bytes).

---

### **Sample Queries for PostgreSQL**

#### **1. Insert Data into `ucs_collections`:**

```sql
INSERT INTO ucs_collections (collection_name, device_name, device_ip, ucg_source, vendor)
VALUES 
('Collection1', 'DeviceA', '192.168.1.1', 'SNMP', 'VendorX'),
('Collection2', 'DeviceB', '192.168.1.2', 'WSS', 'VendorY');
```

#### **2. Insert Data into `collection_metrics`:**

```sql
INSERT INTO collection_metrics (collection_name, number_of_msgs, size_of_msgs)
VALUES 
('Collection1', 1000, 204800),
('Collection2', 500, 102400);
```

#### **3. Retrieve Data with Join:**

To fetch all collections and their associated metrics:

```sql
SELECT c.id AS collection_id, c.collection_name, c.device_name, c.device_ip, 
       m.id AS metric_id, m.last_updated, m.number_of_msgs, m.size_of_msgs
FROM ucs_collections c
LEFT JOIN collection_metrics m ON c.collection_name = m.collection_name;
```

#### **4. Update Data in `collection_metrics`:**

```sql
UPDATE collection_metrics
SET number_of_msgs = 1200, size_of_msgs = 250000
WHERE collection_name = 'Collection1';
```

#### **5. Delete a Collection and Cascade:**

When deleting a collection, the related metrics are automatically deleted:

```sql
DELETE FROM ucs_collections
WHERE collection_name = 'Collection1';
```

---

### **Summary of Changes for PostgreSQL:**

1. **Tables:**
   - The `id` column is defined as **`SERIAL`** for auto-incrementing, making it the **primary key** for each table.
   - **`collection_name`** is **`UNIQUE`** in both tables, ensuring that each collection has a distinct name.

2. **Foreign Key Relationship:**
   - **`collection_name`** in `collection_metrics` is defined as a **foreign key** referencing the `collection_name` in `ucs_collections`.
   - **`ON DELETE CASCADE`** ensures that when a collection is deleted, its associated metrics are automatically deleted as well.

3. **Data Types:**
   - **`INET`** is used for storing IP addresses in `device_ip`.
   - **`TIMESTAMP`** for the `last_updated` column, with a default value set to the current timestamp.

4. **Constraints:**
   - **`PRIMARY KEY`** ensures each row is unique based on the `id`.
   - **`UNIQUE`** ensures that the `collection_name` is unique across both tables.

5. **Sample Queries:**
   - Insert, update, select, and delete queries are provided, including the **JOIN** operation to fetch data from both tables.

This structure uses PostgreSQL-specific types like **`SERIAL`** for auto-increment and **`INET`** for IP addresses, ensuring both uniqueness and data integrity for your collections and their metrics.






### **Essential API Requirements for Scatter Plot Visualization**

To ensure the scatter plot functions correctly with dynamic updates based on user input, the following are the key APIs required:

---

### **1. Get Collection Data API**

#### **Purpose:**
Fetches collection metadata, which includes device details and protocol information needed for the scatter plot.

Fetches the metrics (like number of messages, message size) for a specific collection required to plot the scatter plot.

#### **Endpoint:**
- **GET /api/metrics/{collection_name}**

#### **Request:**
- **Path Parameter:** `collection_name` (the name of the collection)

#### **Response:**
```json
{
  "collection_name": "Collection1",
  "last_updated": "2024-11-20T10:30:00Z",
  "number_of_msgs": 1000,
  "size_of_msgs": 204800
}
```

#### **Why We Need It:**
- This data (metrics) is essential to visualize the scatter plot, specifically the x and y axis values like the number of messages and message size.

---

### **3. Get Scatter Plot Data API**

#### **Purpose:**
Retrieves both collection and metric data based on selected protocol and data type (e.g., number of messages or size of messages) to populate the scatter plot.

#### **Endpoint:**
- **GET /api/scatter-plot-data**

#### **Request Parameters:**
- `protocol`: (SNMP, WSS, etc.)
- `data_type`: (e.g., "number_of_msgs", "size_of_msgs")

```json
{
  "scatter_plot_data": [
    {
      "collection_name": "Collection1",
      "x_value": 1000,  // Represents number of messages
      "y_value": 204800 // Represents size of messages
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Why We Need It:**
- This API is used to fetch the data required for dynamically rendering the scatter plot. It ensures that only relevant data (based on the user's protocol and data type selection) is fetched.

---

### **4. Filter Data by Protocol API**

#### **Purpose:**
Filters the available collections by the selected protocol (e.g., SNMP, WSS, gRPC), allowing users to visualize only the data for a specific protocol.

#### **Endpoint:**
- **GET /api/filter-by-protocol**

#### **Request Parameters:**
- `protocol`: (SNMP, WSS, gRPC, etc.)

      "ucg_source": "SNMP",
      "vendor": "VendorX"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Why We Need It:**
- This ensures that the scatter plot can be filtered based on the selected protocol, allowing users to narrow down the data they are visualizing.

---

### **5. Get Available Protocols API**

#### **Purpose:**
Fetches the list of protocols supported, so users can select which protocol they want to visualize data for.

#### **Endpoint:**
- **GET /api/protocols**

#### **Response:**
```json
{
  "protocols": ["SNMP", "WSS", "gRPC", "TL1", "syslog"]
}
```

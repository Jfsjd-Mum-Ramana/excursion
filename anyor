Create a scheduler.
Develop a single stored procedure (STP) to delete records from the hpov_s2im_devices_audit and hpov_s2im_transactions tables.
Configure the STP to run once a week at midnight (UTC) to delete the records.


These are the column values of the table

transaction_id |server_id|is_updated_host|collected_time     |
(hpov_s2im_transactions)


operation|update_timestamp   |userid  |ip_address    |host_name  |
(hpov_s2im_devices_audit)

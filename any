Positive Test Scenarios:

1. **Successful Authentication**:
   - Provide a valid public/private key pair.
   - Send a request to the custom-ssh-collector application for authentication.
   - Expect a successful authentication response with a 200 OK status.
   - Verify that the response contains a JSON message saying "Authentication Successful".

2. **Invalid Key Pair**:
   - Provide an invalid public/private key pair.
   - Send a request to the custom-ssh-collector application for authentication.
   - Expect an authentication failure response with a 401 Unauthorized status.
   - Verify that the response contains a JSON message saying "Invalid Key Pair".

Negative Test Scenarios:

1. **Missing Key Pair without a valid username/password**:
   - Do not provide a public/private key pair.
   - Send a request to the custom-ssh-collector application for authentication.
   - Expect an authentication failure response with a 401 Unauthorized status.
   - Verify that the response contains a JSON message saying "Invalid Key Pair".

2. **Missing Username/Password with a missing key pair**:
   - Do not provide a public/private key pair or a valid username/password pair.
   - Send a request to the custom-ssh-collector application for authentication.
   - Expect an authentication failure response with a 401 Unauthorized status.
   - Verify that the response contains a JSON message saying "Invalid Key Pair".

3. **Missing Key Pair with a valid username/password**:
   - Do not provide a public/private key pair, but provide a valid username/password pair.
   - Send a request to the custom-ssh-collector application for authentication.
   - Expect an authentication failure response with a 401 Unauthorized status.
   - Verify that the response contains a JSON message saying "Invalid Key Pair".

4. **Invalid Username/Password with a missing key pair**:
   - Do not provide a public/private key pair, but provide an invalid username/password pair.
   - Send a request to the custom-ssh-collector application for authentication.
   - Expect an authentication failure response with a 401 Unauthorized status.
   - Verify that the response contains a JSON message saying "Invalid Key Pair".

These test scenarios cover both positive and negative cases to ensure that the custom-ssh-collector application behaves correctly according to the specified requirements.

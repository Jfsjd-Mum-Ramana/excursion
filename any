Sure, here are the testing scenarios (both positive and negative) for copying files, including handling nested folders and pushing them to S3.

### Positive Scenarios

1. **Basic File Copy**
   - **Scenario**: Successfully copy a single file from the remote directory.
   - **Given** a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
   - **And** a remote directory `/remote/data` containing a single file `file1.txt`
   - **And** the local directory `/local/data` exists
   - **When** the `retrieveData` method is called with `dateReceived` and `auditTopic`
   - **Then** the method should copy `file1.txt`
   - **And** download it to the local directory
   - **And** push it to S3
   - **And** send a successful collection audit message to the Kafka audit topic

2. **Nested Folders and Files Copy**
   - **Scenario**: Successfully copy files within nested folders.
   - **Given** a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
   - **And** a remote directory `/remote/data` containing nested folders and files
   - **When** the `retrieveData` method is called with `dateReceived` and `auditTopic`
   - **Then** the method should recursively copy all files and directories
   - **And** create any missing local directories
   - **And** download files to the corresponding local directories
   - **And** push all files to S3 with appropriate keys
   - **And** send successful collection audit messages to the Kafka audit topic for each successfully processed file

3. **ZIP File Handling During Copy**
   - **Scenario**: Successfully handle and process ZIP files within nested folders during copy.
   - **Given** a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
   - **And** a remote directory `/remote/data` containing a ZIP file `archive.zip` with nested files
   - **When** the `retrieveData` method is called with `dateReceived` and `auditTopic`
   - **Then** the method should copy the ZIP file
   - **And** extract its contents to the local directory
   - **And** process the extracted files
   - **And** push all files to S3 with appropriate keys
   - **And** send successful collection audit messages to the Kafka audit topic for each successfully processed file

### Negative Scenarios

1. **Missing Remote Directory During Copy**
   - **Scenario**: Handle the case where the remote directory does not exist during copy.
   - **Given** a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
   - **And** a remote directory `/remote/nonexistent` that does not exist
   - **When** the `retrieveData` method is called with `dateReceived` and `auditTopic`
   - **Then** the method should log an error
   - **And** send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic

2. **Inaccessible File During Copy**
   - **Scenario**: Handle the case where a file in the remote directory is inaccessible during copy.
   - **Given** a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
   - **And** a remote directory `/remote/data` containing an inaccessible file `file1.txt`
   - **When** the `retrieveData` method is called with `dateReceived` and `auditTopic`
   - **Then** the method should log an error for the inaccessible file
   - **And** send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic for the inaccessible file
   - **And** continue processing remaining files

3. **Failure to Create Local Directory During Copy**
   - **Scenario**: Handle the case where a local directory cannot be created during copy.
   - **Given** a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
   - **And** a remote directory `/remote/data` containing a nested folder `folder1`
   - **And** the local directory `/local/data/folder1` cannot be created
   - **When** the `retrieveData` method is called with `dateReceived` and `auditTopic`
   - **Then** the method should log an error for the directory creation failure
   - **And** send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic for the failed directory creation
   - **And** continue processing remaining files and directories

4. **ZIP File Extraction Failure During Copy**
   - **Scenario**: Handle the case where extraction of a ZIP file fails during copy.
   - **Given** a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
   - **And** a remote directory `/remote/data` containing a ZIP file `corrupt.zip`
   - **When** the `retrieveData` method is called with `dateReceived` and `auditTopic`
   - **Then** the method should copy the ZIP file
   - **And** log an error if the ZIP file extraction fails
   - **And** send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic for the failed extraction
   - **And** continue processing remaining files and directories

### Implementing the Scenarios

To implement these scenarios, you can use the `Gherkin` syntax in your feature files. Here are some examples of how the Gherkin syntax might look:

**Example Feature File for Positive Scenarios**

```gherkin
Feature: Copy nested folders and files to S3

  Scenario: Successfully copy a single file from the remote directory
    Given a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
    And a remote directory "/remote/data" containing a single file "file1.txt"
    And the local directory "/local/data" exists
    When the retrieveData method is called with "2024-06-01" and "auditTopic"
    Then the method should copy "file1.txt"
    And download it to the local directory
    And push it to S3
    And send a successful collection audit message to the Kafka audit topic

  Scenario: Successfully copy files within nested folders
    Given a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
    And a remote directory "/remote/data" containing nested folders and files
    When the retrieveData method is called with "2024-06-01" and "auditTopic"
    Then the method should recursively copy all files and directories
    And create any missing local directories
    And download files to the corresponding local directories
    And push all files to S3 with appropriate keys
    And send successful collection audit messages to the Kafka audit topic for each successfully processed file

  Scenario: Successfully handle and process ZIP files within nested folders during copy
    Given a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
    And a remote directory "/remote/data" containing a ZIP file "archive.zip" with nested files
    When the retrieveData method is called with "2024-06-01" and "auditTopic"
    Then the method should copy the ZIP file
    And extract its contents to the local directory
    And process the extracted files
    And push all files to S3 with appropriate keys
    And send successful collection audit messages to the Kafka audit topic for each successfully processed file
```

**Example Feature File for Negative Scenarios**

```gherkin
Feature: Handle errors during copying nested folders and files

  Scenario: Handle the case where the remote directory does not exist during copy
    Given a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
    And a remote directory "/remote/nonexistent" that does not exist
    When the retrieveData method is called with "2024-06-01" and "auditTopic"
    Then the method should log an error
    And send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic

  Scenario: Handle the case where a file in the remote directory is inaccessible during copy
    Given a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
    And a remote directory "/remote/data" containing an inaccessible file "file1.txt"
    When the retrieveData method is called with "2024-06-01" and "auditTopic"
    Then the method should log an error for the inaccessible file
    And send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic for the inaccessible file
    And continue processing remaining files

  Scenario: Handle the case where a local directory cannot be created during copy
    Given a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
    And a remote directory "/remote/data" containing a nested folder "folder1"
    And the local directory "/local/data/folder1" cannot be created
    When the retrieveData method is called with "2024-06-01" and "auditTopic"
    Then the method should log an error for the directory creation failure
    And send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic for the failed directory creation
    And continue processing remaining files and directories

  Scenario: Handle the case where extraction of a ZIP file fails during copy
    Given a SpaceCollector with valid SSH credentials
    And a remote directory "/remote/data" containing a ZIP file "corrupt.zip"
    When the retrieveData method is called with "2024-06-01" and "auditTopic"
    Then the method should copy the ZIP file
    And log an error if the ZIP file extraction fails
    And send a collection failure audit message to the Kafka audit topic for the failed extraction
    And continue processing remaining files and directories
```

These scenarios will help ensure that the system is robust and can handle various edge cases during the process of copying files, especially when dealing with nested folders and ZIP files.

3. Verify that the method throws a `CustomLuceneException` when the provided update fields are empty or null.
4. Verify that the method throws a `CustomLuceneException` when the provided update fields contain invalid data types or formats.
5. Verify that the method throws a `CustomLuceneException` when the Lucene index does not exist or cannot be accessed.
